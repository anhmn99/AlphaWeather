# AlphaWeather
This is a minimal weather app for iOS that pulls data from the OpenWeatherMap API and outputs to the user what the overall weather for the day is.

Currently, the functions of this app include:
- Pulling 5 day weather data of a location
- Analyzing the overall weather of the current day, and display a message that summarizes it

Future functions and goals:
- Push a notification to the user every morning or night that summarizes the current or next day's overall forecast.
- Update how the overall weather is analyzed
- Allow user to type in a location (right now, the only way to change the location is to modify it in the source code)
- Allow user to add their name for a personalized greeting
- Allow user to change temperature unit
